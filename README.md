# NOTE TAKER

## Description
The goal of this application is to show what I have learned about Express.js, Modular Routing, and saving and retrieving data from a JSON file.  Moreso, I am displaying my knowledge in the communication between a local server and a client-side application. I learned how to connect the back-end to the front-end and deploy a functional note-taking application to Heroku.

### Specific Objective
Allow a small business owner to write and save notes in order to organize thoughts and keep track of tasks that need to be completed.  

The following tasks can now be completed that allow the business owner to use succesfully use this application:
1. Enter new notes in the right column
2. Clear the note taking section by clicking the plus sign to start a new note
2. Save notes by clicking the save icon 
3. See all saved notes in the left column
4. Click a saved note and see the full note on the right
4. Delete notes by clicking the trash can
